  The Mercedes 722.6 transmission made its first debut here in the United States in 1996. It is used behind 4, 6, 8 
and 12 cylinder gasoline engines, as well as their diesel engines. It is their first completely computer controlled 
transmission and their first to have a transmission with a converter clutch. This electronically controlled 5 speed 
automatic transmission consists of  3 compound planetary gear sets, 3 multiple disc driving clutches, 3 multiple 
disc brake clutches and 2 free-wheel clutches, with 5th gear being overdrive.   The Electronic Transmission 
Controller (ETC) controls transmission operation matching engine performance during the shift phase. The 
driver can choose between 2 driving programs, "S" for standard driving programs and "W" for winter driving 
programs. Winter option provides a second gear start and a higher gear ratio for a reverse movement. Standard 
mode provides a first gear take off and a lower reverse gear ratio.

 To utilize the 722.6 transmission behind the diesel,   
and the 4,  6,  8 and 12 cylinder gas engines, different 
gear ratios and torque capacities are needed. Various 
ratios are  accomplished in 2 ways:
   1. Different size axle ratios in the rear
       differential.
   2. Different ratio planetary gear sets inside the
       transmission. 
 Various amounts of friction and steel plates are used 
to accommodate the required torque capacity through 
different  heights  in  the  apply  piston  or  snap  ring 
groove location. 
 Should an incorrect transmission or rear axle ratio be 
installed into the vehicle, the computer system will 
observe this as a slipping transmission and produce 
gear ratio error codes.
  Should  incorrect  clutch  drums  or  pistons  be  used, 
such  as  a  4  cylinder  set  up  behind  a  12  cylinder 
engine, premature failure of the transmission will be 
the result.
  It  is  for  these  reasons  that  proper  identification  be 
employed when rebuilding or exchanging this unit. To 
order parts from Mercedes, you must provide the VIN 
number.
 Use Figure 1 to locate and identify the transmission 
designation number that is etched into a raised boss 
area  on  the  left  side  of  the  transmission  case.  This 
number   is   matched   to   the   engine   size   which 
determines the gear ratio and clutch capacity of the 
transmission.     There  are  currently  four  different 
planetary gear ratios used in the 722.6 unit.
 NAG1 identifies a family of transmissions and means 
"N"ew   "A"utomatic   "G"earbox,   generation   1. 
Various  marketing  names  are  associated  with  the 
NAG1  family  of  transmissions,  depending  on  the 
transmission   variation   being   used   in   a   specific 
vehicle.  Some examples of the marketing names are 
W5A300 and W5A580.  Refer to Figure 1.
   Transmission   and   Engine   designations   can   be 
identified and cross referenced to the year, model and 
in some cases the VIN number, for Mercedes vehicles 
from   1996-2001,   equipped   with   the   722.6 
transmission.
 For Mercedes model years 1996-2001, refer to Figure 
2 and Figure 3.
 For Mercedes model years 2002-2004, refer to Figure 
4.
 For Daimler/Chrysler models that are equipped with 
the 722.6 transmission, refer to Figure 5.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION
    The  Mercedes  722.6  transmission  made  its  first 
debut in the United States in 1996.  It is used behind 4, 
6, 8 and 12 cylinder gasoline engines, as well as their 
diesel  engines.  It  is  their  first  completely  computer 
controlled  transmission  and  their  first  transmission 
equipped with a converter clutch. This fully electronic 
controlled five speed automatic transmission consists 
of   3 compound planetary gear sets, 3 multiple disc 
driving clutches, 3 multiple disc brake clutches and 2 
free-wheel  (sprag)  clutches,  with  5th  gear  being 
overdrive.   The three planetary gear sets provide the 
five forward gear ratios and two ratios for reverse.
    Changing  gear  ratios  is  fully  automatic  and  is 
accomplished on the Mercedes units with the use of 
an Electronic Transmission Controller   (ETC).   On 
the  Daimler/Chrysler  units,  it  is  referred  to  as  a 
Transmission Control Module (TCM).   Both of the 
controllers  are  the  same  and  in  this  manual  will  be 
referred to as a Transmission Control Module (TCM), 
regardless of the application.
   The TCM receives and monitors various electronic 
sensor inputs, and uses this information to shift the 
transmission at the optimum time and also controls 
line pressure. 
   The TCM commands shift solenoids and variable 
bleed  Pulse  Width  Modulated  (PWM)  solenoids 
within the transmission to control shift timing.   The 
TCM controls shift feel through the PWM solenoids.  
The TCM also controls the apply and release of the 
torque  converter  clutch  which  allows  the  engine  to 
deliver   the   maximum   fuel   efficiency   without 
sacrificing vehicle performance.
    On  Mercedes  vehicles  the  driver  can  also  choose 
between 2 driving programs, "S" for standard driving 
programs  and  "W"  for  winter  driving  programs. 
Winter  option  provides  a  second  gear  start  and  a 
higher  gear  ratio  for  a  reverse  movement.  Standard 
mode provides a first gear take off and a lower reverse 
gear ratio. 
   The friction components used in this transmission 
consist  of  six  multiple  disc  clutches.   The  multiple 
disc  clutches  combine  with  two  mechanical  sprag 
clutches, to deliver five forward gear ratios, and two 
reverse gear ratios, through the gearsets to the output 
shaft.   Refer to Figure 6 for the internal component 
location   and   application   chart   for   the   722.6 
transmission.

Technical Service Information
3-4 Shift solenoid is pulsed continuously while in Park and during selector lever 
movement  (Garage Shifts).
a) Pulsed constantly while idling in Park or Neutral at approximately 40% Duty cycle.
b) Voltage observed varied with throttle opening as well as during selector lever movement.
a) Pulsed constantly while idling in Park or Neutral at approximately 33% Duty cycle. 
b) Voltage observed varied with throttle opening during each gear shift only.
* The TCC solenoid is also Pulse Width Modulated and duty cycles to apply the clutch.
* The TCC is available in 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th gears, based on vehicle speed, throttle position and ATF temp.
1-2/4-5 Solenoid is pulsed during ignition crank.
Additional solenoid activity observed:
   From the solenoid shift chart below, you will notice that shift solenoids 1-2/4-5, 2-3 and 3-4 are toggled 
“on-to-off” to make there respective shifts. While in gear they remain in the “off” state. This explains why, 
while you are driving, whatever the gear the transmission was in at the time the computer system observed a 
fault, that would be the gear the transmission failsafes to. When the vehicle is brought to a stop and the 
ignition is cycled, the transmission will remain in second gear. Special Note: If codes are stored and repairs 
have been made, all codes must be cleared for the limp mode feature to be turned off.  
  By viewing the mechanical, hydraulic and electrical operation of a shift, it can be observed that a specific 
solenoid and a group of valves cause a clutch application change. This is described as a "Shift Group." A shift 
group has two phases. The transition from one gear to the next is called a "shift phase." Once the shift is 
complete and the transmission is in gear it is called the "stationary phase." There are a total of three shift 
groups with which 5 forward speeds are achieved. In a shift phase, a shift solenoid initiates the application of 
one group of valves   to change the clutches required for that shift. During this time the other two groups 
remain in the stationary phase.

OIL LEVEL CONTROLEFFECTS OF INCORRECT FLUID LEVEL
The "Float" prevents
expanded or overfilled
ATF from reaching the
gearset chamber.
ATF above
the full level.
   The oil level is controlled with a "float", that is an 
integral part of the valve body assembly, as shown in 
Figure 9.  The "float" is positioned so that it can plug 
the opening between the transmission sump and the 
gearset chamber so that the rotating gearsets do not 
create  foaming,  aerate  the  fluid,  or  force  it  out  the 
breather.   With normal oil levels, the lubricating oil 
which flows constantly out of the gearset, flows back 
to the sump through the bottom case opening.  When 
the oil level rises (as fluid is heated), the oil presses 
the "float" against the opening.  The "float" therefore 
seperates  the  transmission  sump  from  the  gearset 
chamber.  The lubricating oil which continues to flow 
out of the gearsets is thrown against the case wall and 
returns  to  the  sump  through  the  upper  opening,  as 
shown in Figure 9.
   A low fluid level allows the oil pump to take in air 
along with the fluid.   Air in the fluid will cause oil 
pressures to be low and pressures will develop slower 
than normal.
    If  the  transmission  is  overfilled,  the  gearsets  will 
churn the fluid into foam.   This aerates the fluid and 
can  cause  the  same  conditions  that  occur  with  low 
fluid  levels.    Foaming  also  causes  fluid  expansion 
which can result in fluid overflow from the vent or fill 
tube.  Fluid overflow can easily be mistaken for a leak 
if inspection is not done carefully.

SOLENOID LOCATIONS AND IDENTIFICATION
Solenoid Locations And Identification
  All models of the 722.6 transmission use a total of six 
solenoids mounted on the electronic conductor plate 
and  the  valve  body,  as  shown  in  Figure  10.    The 
solenoids  are  located  under  2  white  plastic  covers, 
also show in Figure 10.   Earlier valve bodies do not 
have these covers.   They were added to help protect 
the  electrical  connections  from  shorts  created  by 
metal particles that may be floating in the fluid. 
   These covers are not available seperately for retro-
fitting.   When  a  new  conductor  plate  is  purchased, 
covers should accompany the conductor plate.
  The location of the "Float", that is used for oil level 
control is also shown in Figure 10.

Shift Pressure Control (SPC)
Solenoid Operation
  The Modulated Pressure Control (MPC) Solenoid is 
the line pressure control solenoid which controls main 
line  pressure  rise.    This  solenoid  is  located  in  the 
electrical conductor plate, uses no "O" ring seals and 
relys strictly on the machined surfaces of the solenoid 
and the upper valve body to seal the oil pressure.  This 
solenoid is a Pulse Width Modulated solenoid which 
is  supplied  a  variable  current  flow  from  the  TCM. 
When  the  solenoid  is  at  minimum  exhaust,  line 
pressure is high. When the solenoid is at maximum 
exhaust, line pressure is low.   The MPC Solenoid is 
constantly  pulse-width  modulating  and  fluctuates 
with throttle movement.  Refer to Figure 11.
   The MPC and SPC solenoids are interchangeable 
and work in tandem together to control holding clutch 
pressure  as  well  as  to  assist  the  shift  solenoids  to 
control shift feel.
   The Torque Converter Clutch (TCC) Solenoid   is a 
Pulse   Width   Modulated   solenoid   that   regulates 
pressure  to  the  torque  converter  clutch  through  the 
TCC  control  valve  in  the  valve  body.    The  TCC 
Solenoid is located in the electrical conductor plate, 
uses  one  "O"  ring  seal  and  also  relys  on  machined 
surfaces of the bottom stem of solenoid and the valve 
body to seal the oil pressure. Converter clutch apply 
pressure is controlled in order to "ramp" the converter 
clutch  on  and  off  making  for  a  smooth  converter 
clutch  apply  and  release.  When  the  solenoid  is  at 
maximum exhaust, the converter clutch is released.. 
When solenoid is at minimum exhaust, the converter 
clutch is fully applied.  Refer to Figure 13.
  The Shift Pressure Control (SPC) Solenoid regulates 
oil pressure to all clutch packs to control the pressure 
cutback during a shift, as well as the clamping force 
needed  to  prevent  a  clutch  from  slipping.     This 
solenoid is located in the electrical conductor plate, 
uses  no  "O"  ring  seals  and  relys  strictly  on  the 
machined surfaces of the solenoid and the upper valve 
body to seal the oil pressure.  This solenoid is a Pulse 
Width   Modulated   solenoid   which   is   supplied   a 
variable  current  flow  from  the  TCM.  When  the 
solenoid  is  at  minimum  exhaust,  clutch  pressure  is 
high.  When  the  solenoid  is  at  maximum  exhaust, 
clutch pressure is low.  Refer to Figure 12.
   The SPC and MPC solenoids are interchangeable 
and work in tandem together to control holding clutch 
pressure  as  well  as  to  assist  the  shift  solenoids  to 
control shift feel.
   The 1-2/4-5, 2-3, and 3-4 Shift Solenoids are all 
"On/Off",   normally   closed   solenoids.  The   shift 
solenoids  are  located  in  the  electrical  conductor 
plate, uses 2 "O" ring seals to seal the oil pressure. 
When the solenoid is "ON", it opens and transmits 
shift valve command pressure to the corresponding 
shift valve. When the solenoid is "OFF", shift valve 
command oil pressure is blocked.   Refer to Figure 
14.
    The  1-2/4-5,  2-3,  and  3-4  Shift  Solenoids  are 
toggled "On" to make the shift and when the shift is 
complete, they are toggled "Off" and remain in the 
"Off" state.
  The three shift solenoids are also interchangeable.

Figure 17
  The Transmission Fluid Temperature (TFT) sensor is 
located in, and part of, the electrical conductor plate, 
as shown in Figure 17.   Its purpose is to measure the 
fluid temp and pass that information to the TCM as an 
input signal.   The TFT sensor is wired in series with 
the  Park/Neutral  contact.     The  fluid  temperature 
signal is transferred to the TCM only when the dry-
reed  contact  of  the  Park/Neutral  contact  is  closed, 
when in Reverse or a forward gear position.  In Park 
or Neutral the TCM  uses engine temperature to avoid 
setting a DTC. Refer to the chart in Figure 18 to check 
the TFT using either voltage or resistance.
Note: If check is being made at the TCM, shift lever 
must be in Reverse or Drive, as engine temp
is used in Park and Neutral.
   The Park/Neutral Contact is located in, and part of, 
the   electrical   conductor   plate   with   the   plunger 
protruding, as shown in Figure 17.   Its purpose is to 
transfer  information  to  the  TCM  as  to  when  the 
selector lever is in the "P" or "N" positions.  When in 
"P" or "N" the P/N contact is acuated by the inside 
detent plate.   The permanent magnet is moved away 
from  the  dry-reed  contact.   The  dry-reed  contact  is 
opened, and the TCM recieves an electrical signal that 
will close the signal to the starter circuit.   Cut-Away 
of the P/N Contact is shown in Figure 17.

   The 722.6 transmission uses 2 input speed sensors 
referred  to  as  N2  and  N3.    Both  speed  sensors  are 
located in the electrical conductor plate, as shown in 
Figure 19.   The speed sensors are Hall Effect speed 
sensors  that  are  used  by  the  TCM  to  calculate  the 
transmissions  input  speed.    Since  the  input  speed 
could  not  be  measured  directly,  two  of  the  drive 
elements are measured.   N2 records the speed of the 
front sun gear and N3 records the speed of the front 
planetary  carrier.    Two  input  speed  sensors  were 
required because both drive elements are not active in 
all gears.  The input sensors N2 and N3 will report the 
same input speed in 2nd, 3rd or 4th gear.  If the N2 and 
N3 input speed signals are not the same in these gears, 
then there is an issue with the transmission and the 
DTC for "Input Speed Sensors Mismatch" will be set.
  The N3 input speed sensor is not reported in 1st and 
5th gears.  The N2 input speed sensor is not reported 
in Reverse.   The Input Speed Sensor Overspeed is a 
rationality check that is intended to indicate a major 
transmission  failure  and  will  cause  a  loss  of  drive, 
with transmission going to neutral.

ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS (CONT'D)
Transmission Control Module (TCM)
     The  722.6  electronic  operated  transmission  is 
controlled by a Transmission Control Module (TCM) 
and has a fully adaptive control system. The system 
performs its functions based on real time sensor and 
switch feedback information.   In addition the TCM 
recieves information from the Shift Lever Assembly 
(SLA), Engine Control Module (ECM) and Anti-lock 
Brake System (ABS) controllers over the CAN bus.   
The CAN bus is a high speed comunication bus that 
allows  real  time  control  capability  between  various 
controllers.      Most   messages   are   sent   every   20 
milliseconds.   This allows critical information to be 
shared with the SLA, ECM and ABS controllers.  The 
CAN bus uses a twisted pair of wires in the harness to 
reduce the potential of radio and noise interference.
  The control system automatically adapts to changes 
in   engine   performance,   vehicle   speed,   and 
transmission   temperature   variations   to   provide 
consistant shift quality.   The control system ensures 
that   clutch   operation   during   upshifting   and 
downshifting  is  more  responsive  without  increased 
harshness.    The  TCM  controls  the  actuation  of  the 
solenoids  for  modulating  shift  pressure  and  gear 
change.    The  required  pressure  level  is  calculated 
from the load condition and engine speed.  Power for 
the  transmission  system  is  supplied  through  the 
Transmission Relay to the TCM. 
   Note:  The  TCM  is  the  same  type  between  the 
Mercedes  and  Chrysler  vehicle  applications,  right 
down to the connectors and the terminal numbers.   
Obviously  calibrations  are  different  between  the 
various models.
   Transmission Control Module (TCM) locations for 
the  various  vehicle  applications  are  illustrated  in 
Figure 21.
     The  TCM   continuously   checks   for   electrical 
concerns, mechanical concerns, and some hydraulic 
concerns.   When a transmission concern is detected, 
the TCM  stores  a  Diagnostic Trouble  Code  (DTC). 
Some of these codes cause the transmission to go into 
"Limp-In"  or  Default  mode.  The  transmission  will 
default in the current gear if a DTC is detected, then 
after a key cycle, or a shift to Park, the transmission 
will  go  into  "Limp-In"  which  is  2nd  or  3rd  gear, 
depending  on  model.    Some  DTC's  may  allow  the 
transmission to resume normal operation, or recover, 
if the detected concern goes away. 
TRANSMISSION CONTROL MODULE (TCM)
   Permanent "Limp-In" DTC will recover when the 
key is cycled, but if the same DTC is detected for three 
key cycles, the system will not recover and the DTC 
must  be  cleared  from  the  TCM  using  the  proper 
scanner.  The "Typical" TCM is shown in Figure 20.
Figure 20
Limp Mode Operation
Loss of Drive
   Certain malfunctions will cause the transmission to 
enter limp mode at which time a diagnostic trouble 
code will be stored. Should an electrical fault occur, 
the last selected gear will be the gear the transmission 
remains in until the vehicle is stopped, the engine is 
turned off, 10 seconds have passed and the engine is 
restarted. At this time 2nd gear will be hydraulically 
available.      Some   models   it   will   be   3rd   gear 
hydraulically  available.  In  all  situations  reverse  is 
also available.
   Limp mode remains active until the malfunction is 
eliminated, or in some cases the key is cycled. In some 
cases limp mode is canceled because the fault is no 
longer present.
  If the TCM detects a situation that has resulted in or 
may  result  in  engine  or  transmission  failure  the 
transmission  will  be  placed  in  neutral.    Improper 
Ratio, Input Sensor Overspeed, or Engine Overspeed 
DTC's will create a loss of Drive.

ELECTRICAL AND RESISTANCE CHECKS
  Electrical and resistance checks can be easily as the 
TCM  is  located  in  one  of  five  areas,  as  shown  in 
Figure  21.    The  only  one  that  is  troubling  for  the 
technician   is   the   one   in   the   Sprinter,   which   is 
underneath the drivers seat.  The TCM is small in size 
when compared to other control modules on board the 
vehicle.   It measures approximately 5-1/4" X 4-1/4" 
X 3/4".  There are two connectors which plug into the 
TCM and are identified in Figure 22.  The face of the 
connectors  have  the  terminal  numbers  embossed  in 
them  for  circuit  identification  and  also  shown  in 
Figure 22.  
  With the TCM connectors disconnected, many of the 
internal  components  can  be  checked  for  proper 
resistance readings.  If a specific wire is a concern or 
needs to be inspected, continuity checks can also be 
easily   accomplished   between   the  TCM   and   the 
vehicle harness at the 13-way connector.
  We have provided you with a chart in Figure 23 with 
the resistance specifications for the solenoids.

STANDARD SHIFT LEVER ASSEMBLYDRIVER SHIFT CONTROL SHIFT LEVER ASSEMBLY
       - Park position enables the engine to be started 
while preventing the vehicle from moving.  For safety 
reasons, the vehicle's parking brake should always be 
used in addition to the "Park" position. 
       - Reverse enables the vehicle to be operated in a 
rearward direction.
       - Neutral position enables the engine to start and 
operate without driving the vehicle.  If necessary, this 
position should be selected to restart the engine while 
the vehicle is moving.
   The transmission Shift Lever Assemblies   vary by 
model.  There may be four to eight different positions 
shown on the shift quadrants, as shown in Figure 24 
and Figure 25.   All are equipped with a W/S Mode 
Selector   Switch   and   a   Transmission   Range 
Recognition Switch (TRRS).
             - Drive range should be used for all normal 
driving conditions for maximum efficiency and fuel 
economy.    Drive  range  allows  the  transmission  to 
operate  in  each  of  the  five  forward  gear  ratios.    
Downshifts  to  a  lower  gear  are  available  for  safe 
passing, by depressing the accelerator, or by manually 
selecting a lower gear with the shift lever.
In this position the Driver has the option to push the 
lever to the left or to the right.   To the right would 
allow a shift sequence up to 5th gear while pushed to 
the left side would inhibit 5th gear.

Vehicle Towing
 "S"   This is a Standard driving program which will 
provide a first gear start when in the 4<>D or the -D+ 
selector  position.  When  the  Reverse  position  is 
selected, a 3.16:1 ratio is available.
 "W"   This is a Winter driving program which will 
provide a second gear start when in the 4<>D or the -
D+  selector  position. When  the  Reverse  position  is 
selected, a 1.93:1 ratio is available.  The Winter mode 
is to increase the probability of removing the vehicle 
from a stuck condition.
   If the vehicle must be flat towed, it should be done 
with only the "N" position selected, for a maximum               
towing  range  of  32  miles  (50  km),  at  a  maximum 
speed of 32 mph (50 km/h).

   When in this range, the driver may also manually 
select the range of gears by tapping the selector lever

shown in Figure 25 on Page 24.  The transmission will 
shift up or down depending on the request that is made 
by tapping the selector lever.

turned off, 10 seconds have passed and the engine is 
restarted. At this time 2nd gear will be hydraulically 
available.      Some   models   it   will   be   3rd      gear 
hydrauically available. In all situations reverse is also 
available.
   Limp mode remains active until the malfunction is

The  Shift  Lever Assembly  mechanism  as  shown  in 
Figure 24 and Figure 25, also contains an electrical 
Transmission Range Recognition Switch (TRRS) and 
the Park/Lock Solenoid. The TRRS informs the TCM 
of the shift lever position.   The 1996 to 1999 models 
are "hard wired" to the TCM.   The 2000-Up models 
have the TRRS signals sent to the TCM via the CAN 
bus system and require the proper scanner to moniter 
and test.
   With the TRRS  being an integral part of  the gear 
Shift Lever Assembly mechanism which is located on 
the  floor  in  the  center  console,  rain  water  from  an 
open sun roof, a coffee or soda spill is all it takes to 
damage this switch.  The TRRS is a commonly failed 
device  that  produces  complaints  such  as    delayed 
engagements   or   no   up-shifts.   The   no   up-shift 
complaint  is  at  times,  accompanied  with  the TRRS 
switch  manual low indicator light stuck on regardless 
of the selector lever position.
ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS (CONT'D)
Transmission Range Recognition Switch (TRRS)
  With the face plate removed, the TRRS circuit board 
can be easily seen.  This circuit board has attached to 
it wires   which run to a connector in the rear of the 
assembly.   Shown in Figure 26 is a wiring diagram 
which could be used to assist in diagnosing the TRRS 
from the TCM connector. However, should the TRRS 
switch  need  to  be  replaced,  the  entire  Shift  Lever 
Assembly must be purchased.

HOW TO READ THE MERCEDES DTC CHART
DTC Column
DTC "INT" Column
DTC OBD Column
"Limp Mode" Column
"Auto Reset" Column
"Key Reset" Column
  All 1 or 2 digit DTC's between 2 and 65 are actual Mercedes fault codes at the time of code retrieval.
  All DTC codes higher than 96 are fault codes that occured previously, or Intermittently.
  Example: A code 2 that occured previously would be displayed as 98 (2 + 96).
  All codes in this column are OBD II codes that are found in the U.S. only, on OBD II compliant vehicles, and are 
equal to the Mercedes 2 digit codes.
  An X in this column means that it is a code that puts the transmission in "Full Limp Mode", transmission does 
not shift, remains in the same gear as when the fault occured.  After moving the shift lever to the Park position, 
cycle ignition to OFF, wait 10 seconds and restart engine.  Transmission will now be in 2nd gear (3rd gear some 
models) and reverse will be available.  To restore transmission function, if the fault is nonexistent, you must use 
the proper scanner to clear the codes, cycle ignition to OFF and restart engine.
  An A in this column means, Limp Mode only when faults 22 and 23 occur simultaneously.  With implausible 
input, TCM defaults to a pre-programmed, fixed, substitution value, (L/RR, R/RR = 2500 rpm).
    A    B  in  this  column  means,  with  implausible  signal  input,  TCM  defaults  to  a  pre-programmed,  fixed 
substitution value.
  A  C in this column means, with implausible signal input, TCM defaults to a variable substitution value, with 
loss of one rear wheel speed sensor input.
  A  D in this column means, with implausible signal input, TCM defaults to a variable substitution value, from 
other half of engine control.
  An  E in this column means, delayed starting.
  An  F in this column means, fault induces TCM to re-initalize from beginning, or reset.
  An X in this column means that it's a code that will automatically be eliminated, after fault condition ends.
  An X in this column means that it is a code that can be eliminated by cycling the ignition key OFF to ON.
DIAGNOSTIC TROUBLE CODES (DTC'S)
   We have divided the DTC charts into two different 
catagories.  The Mercedes chart which covers "all" of 
their  known  codes,  beginning  on  Page  30  and  the 
Daimler/Chrysler   updated   OBD-II   code   chart 
beginning on Page 32. 
  The Shift Lever Assembly (SLA) specific codes are 
shown on Page 31.
   The Mercedes code chart can be very confusing at 
times, so we have provided some "instructions" or a 
legend to assist you in understanding the chart.
  Please read or refer to the instructions below before 
you   go   to   the   Mercedes   code   chart.      The 
Daimler/Chrysler  OBD-II  code  chart  is  a  typical 
OBD-II code chart and they have refined the the code 
descriptions.

DATA LINK CONNECTOR (DLC) INFORMATION AND LOCATIONS
DLC No. 1
DLC No. 2
DLC No. 3
DLC No. 4
  This DLC is located in the engine compartment and is a 16 pin diagnostic connector which will 
require a "Code Reader" and will produce 2 digit codes.
   This DLC is located in the engine compartment, same position as DLC No.1, and is very 
similar in appearance.  This DLC is equipped with an L.E.D. Lamp and a push button to retrieve 
2 digit codes.  This style connector is typically used with California emissions.
  This DLC is also located in the engine compartment and is a round 38 terminal connector that 
requires a diagnostic code reader to retrieve 2 digit codes.
  This DLC is typical 16 terminal OBD-II connector, located under the driver side dash panel.  
This will require the proper scanner in order to retrieve the typical OBD-II 5 digit codes. 
  There are four different styles of Data Link Connectors, depending on year of production, vehicle model, if 
the vehicle is equipped with California emissions or if the vehicle is OBD-II compliant.

Clutch ApplyPressure

Turbine Shaft
Converter “Out” fluidreturns to the TCC 
control valve in the VBbetween the Turbine
Shaft and Stator Shaft
Converter “In” fluidenters the converter
between the Stator Shaftand Converter Hub
  The Torque Converter is uniquely constructed in that 
the converter clutch apply circuit is independent to the  
converter in and out fluid. Additionally, the converter 
could contain either 1 or 2 friction plates depending 
on the size of the engine .
  Figure 34 below, illustrates how the converter clutch 
apply  piston  contours  to  the  flywheel  side  of  the 
torque converter cover. The friction plates lug to a hub 
splined to the turbine shaft while the steel plates lug to 
the converter cover. When the clutch is commanded 
on, apply fluid is fed through the center of the turbine 
shaft and fills the area between the converter cover 
and piston. The piston applies the friction plates to the 
steel plates locking the turbine shaft to the cover. 
  Converter fill is fed into the converter  between the 
converter  hub  that  drives  the  pump  gears  and  the 
stator  shaft.  The  fluid’s  return  path  is  between  the 
stator shaft and turbine shaft. 
   The TCM controls the converter clutch apply with 
Electronic  Modulated  Converter  Clutch  (EMCC) 
software using the TCC (PWM) solenoid and the TCC 
valve in the valve body.   There are four output logic 
states that can be applied as follows;
TCC HYDRAULIC OPERATIONTCC ELECTRONIC OPERATION

Gradual-To-No EMCC
Gradual-To-No EMCC
    Under  "No  EMCC"  conditions,  the  TCC  (PWM) 
solenoid is OFF.  There are several conditions that can 
result in "No EMCC" operations.  It can be iniated due 
to a fault in the transmission or because the TCM does 
not  see  the  need  for  EMCC  under  current  driving 
conditions.
  Partial EMCC operation modulates the TCC (PWM) 
solenoid  (duty-cycle)  to  obtain  partial  converter 
clutch application.  Partial EMCC is maintained until 
Full EMCC is called for and actuated.  During Partial 
EMCC  some  slip  does  occur.    Partial  EMCC  will 
usually occur at low vehicle speeds, low load and light 
throttle situations.
   During Full EMCC operation, the TCM increases 
the TCC (PWM) solenoid duty-cycle to full ON, after 
Partial  EMCC  brings  the  engine  speed  within  the 
desired  slip  range  of  transmission  input  speed  in 
relation to engine rpm.
   This operation is to soften the change from Full or 
Partial  EMCC  to  No  EMCC.   This  is  done  at  mid-
throttle by decreasing the TCC (PWM) solenoid duty-
cycle.

SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
    Service  information  provided  in  this  manual  by 
ATSG is intended for use by professional, qualified 
technicians.   Attempting repairs or service without 
the appropriate training, tools and equipment could 
cause injury to you or others.
      The   service   procedures   we   recommend   and 
describe  in  this  manual  are  effective  methods  of 
performing service and repair on this unit.  Some of 
the procedures require the use of special tools that 
are designed for specific purposes.
   This manual contains CAUTIONS that you must 
observe carefully in order to reduce the risk of injury 
to  yourself  or  others.    This  manual  also  contains 
NOTES that must be carefully followed in order to 
avoid improper service that may damage the vehicle, 
tools and/or equipment.
TRANSMISSION DISASSEMBLY
  1. The complete transmission should be steam
       cleaned on the outside, to remove any dirt or
       grease, before disassembly begins.
  2. The standard GM 350 holding fixture works
       just fine on the 722.6 transmission, as shown
       in Figure 41, which will give you the benefit
       of rotating the transmission easily.
  3. Remove the torque converter from transmission
      and set aside to drain.
      Caution: Use care when removing the torque
      converter, to avoid personal injury and/or
      damage to converter, as it is heavy.
  4. Install the holding fixture shown in Figure 41,
      install the unit in bench fixture and rotate the
      transmission so bell is facing up.

       End-play should be 0.3-0.5mm (.012"-.020").
   8. Rotate transmission so that output shaft yoke is
       facing up, as shown in Figure 43.
       Caution: Drain pan may be required under
       transmission to catch fluid.
   9. Place the transmission in the Park position to
       prepare for removal of the output shaft nut.
 10. Remove the output shaft drive yoke retaining
       nut, using a 30 mm, 12 point socket, as shown
       in Figure 43.

 45. The Parking Lock Interlock Linkage (PLIL), as
       shown in Figure 58, cannot be removed unless
       you first remove the lock pawl pivot pin (45),
       lock pawl (46), and lock pawl spring (47).
       Note: The pivot pin is very difficult to remove
       as it goes into a blind hole and "staked".
 46. If the PLIL is not broken and not leaking, our
       suggestion is, leave it alone.
 47. If it does need replacement, you must figure a
       way to remove the pivot pin.
 48. When going back in, the pin also needs some
       type of sealer in the case end.
Transmission Case Assembly
   1. Clean all transmission case parts thoroughly
       and dry with compressed air.
   2. Inspect all transmission case parts thoroughly
       for any wear and/or damage.
   3. Install parking pawl and return spring into the
       case, as shown in Figure 58.
   4. Install new "O" ring seal on the parking pawl
       pivot pin, as shown in Figure 58, and lube with

       and through parking pawl  (See Figure 58).
   6. Install new "O" ring seal on the parking rod
       guide sleeve, as shown in Figure 58, and lube
       with a small amount of Trans-Jel®.
   7. Push down on the parking pawl against spring
       pressure and install parking rod guide sleeve
       into the case bore, with the tension spring on
       the guide sleeve facing away from pan rail, as
       shown in Figure 58.
   8. Install new manual shaft seal into case bore
       using the proper driver  (See Figure 59).
   9. Install the parking rod into the inside detent

 49. Measure B-1 clutch clearance using a feeler
       gauge between the selective snap ring and the
       backing plate, as shown in Figure 83.
 50. B-1 clutch clearance will depend on how many
       friction plates are used in the pack. The proper
       clearances for each are listed in Figure 83.
       Note:  ATSG  clutch clearances vary from
       the Mercedes specification, as Mercedes uses
       a rather costly tool to compress the cushion
       plate in the clutch pack.
 51. Change the selective snap ring as necessary to
       obtain the proper clutch clearance.  There are
       4 different thickness' available and listed in
       Figure 83.
 52. We have provided you with frequently used
       part numbers for the clutches in Figure 82.
       Keep in mind that part numbers can change
       without notice.
 53. Set the completed converter housing, oil pump,
       B-1 clutch assembly aside for final assembly.

       Note: Use a liberal amount of Trans-Jel to
       hold return spring in place as it gets turned
       over for installation.  The balance piston acts
       as a centering device for the spring and it is
       difficult to install unless you use this method.

       Later models may also use "single-sided"
       friction plates.  We will cover the assembly
       process for both.
       All friction plates should be soaked in proper
       fluid for 30 minutes before installation.

 29. Measure K-1 clutch clearance using a feeler
       gauge between the selective snap ring and the
       backing plate, as shown in Figure 97.
 30. K-1 clutch clearance will depend on how many
       friction plates are used in the pack. The proper
       clearances for each are listed in Figure 97.
       Note: ATSG clutch clearances vary from the
       Mercedes specification, as Mercedes uses a
       rather costly tool to compress the cushion
       plate in the clutch pack.
 31. Change the selective snap ring as necessary to
       obtain the proper clutch clearance.  There are
       5 different snap ring thickness' available and
       are listed in Figure 97.
 32. We have provided you with frequently used
       part numbers for the clutches in Figure 95.
       Keep in mind that part numbers can change
       without notice.
 33. Set the completed K-1 clutch housing assembly
       aside for the final assembly process.

   4. For the rebuild process we will begin with the
       K-2 clutch housing and then the K-2 shell.
   5. Disassemble the K-2 clutch housing using
       Figure 100 as a guide.
   6. Clean all K-2 clutch housing parts thoroughly
       and dry with compressed air.
   7. Inspect all K-2 clutch housing parts thoroughly

Continued on Page 71
Caution:  There are currently two different housings 
for  the  K-2  clutch,  with  different  dimensions.  One 
that uses a bushing and one that uses a caged needle 
bearing. This change also affects the dimensionsons 
of the output shaft.
Refer   to   Figure   101   for   the   dimensions   and 
identification.

   8. Install new "O" ring seal onto the K-2 clutch
       balance piston, as shown in Figure 102, and
       lube with small amount of Trans-Jel.
   9. Install new "O" ring seal onto the K-2 clutch
       apply piston, as shown in Figure 103, and lube
       with small amount of Trans-Jel®.
 10. Install new "D" ring seal into the K-2 clutch
       housing, as shown in Figure 104, and lube with
       a small amount of Trans-Jel®.
 11. This would be the time to install a new bushing
       into the housing, if you have the early style,
       and it is deemed necessary.
Special   Note:   It   is   common   to   encounter 
premature  failure  of  the  bushing  inside  the  K-2 
clutch drum which pilots the output shaft causing 
complete  planetary  failure.  Later  models  have 
been upgraded to a Teflon sealing ring and caged 
needle  bearing  arrangement.  Upgrade  packages 
for early designs are available from Mercedes. The 
upgrade package includes a new K-2 clutch drum 
and  output  shaft  as  the  pilot  diameter  changed 
dimensions,  to  accommodate  the  caged  needle 
bearing. You must also select the correct gear ratio 
package to avoid gear ratio errors after rebuild. If 
a  complete  failure  has  not  occurred  with  the 
bushing  style  K-2  clutch  drum  and  the  bushing 
needs to be  replaced, the bushing can be acquired 
through  aftermarket  sources  such  as  Sonnax  or 
Independent transmissions.

 17. Use caution when installing K-2 clutch plates.
       Caution: The K-2 clutch may have 3, 4, 5, or
       6 "double-sided" friction plates depending on
       the model.  Refer to the chart in Figure 108
       for reference.  We have not found any of the
      "single-sided" frictions in the K-2 clutch.
       All friction plates should be soaked in proper
       fluid for 30 minutes before installation.
Figure 108Figure 109
 18. Install the K-2 clutch .071" thick apply plate,
       as shown in Figure 109.
 19. Install "double-sided" clutches beginning with
       a friction plate and alternating with steel plates,
       as shown in Figure 109, until you have proper
       number of plates installed.
      Note: Steel plate thickness will vary depending
       on snap ring groove location and number of
       frictions required  (See chart Figure 108).
 20. Install the K-2 clutch backing plate, as shown
       in Figure 109.
 21. Install the K-2 clutch selective snap ring, as
       shown in Figure 109.

 22. Measure K-2 clutch clearance using a feeler
       gauge between the selective snap ring and the
       backing plate, as shown in Figure 110.
 23. K-2 clutch clearance will depend on how many
       friction plates are used in the pack.  The proper
       clearances for each are listed in Figure 110.
       Note: ATSG clutch clearances vary from the
       Mercedes specification, as Mercedes uses a
       rather costly tool to compress the cushion
       plate in the clutch pack.
Figure 110Figure 111
 24. Change the selective snap ring as necessary to
       obtain the proper clutch clearance.  There are
       5 different snap ring thickness' available and
       are listed in Figure 110.
 25. We have provided you with frequently used
       part numbers for the clutches in Figure 111.
       Keep in mind that part numbers can change
       without notice.

Geartrain Identification And Tooth Count
  Great care must be exercised if replacement parts are 
needed for any of the planetary gearsets in any of the 
vehicles equipped with a 722.6 transmission.
   All  of  the  722.6  transmissions  use  three  different 
planetary  gearsets  and  are  identified  as  the  Front 
Planetary System, Center Planetary System, and Rear 
Planetary  System.    There  are  two  different  ratios 
available  in  North America  and  obviously,  will  not 
interchange.
  There are a wide variety of tooth counts possible for 
all three of the planetary gearsets and in addition you 
may have 3 or 4 pinion carriers, depending on engine 
size.
  This is because of the wide variety of vehicle usage 
from small cars to large trucks; wide variety of engine 
sizes  4  Cyl,  6  Cyl,  8  Cyl,  and  12  Cyl,  and  covers 
eleven different Litre sizes, and also Gas or Diesel.
  Refer to Figure 121 and 122 for identification of the 
individual gearsets and the possible tooth counts for 
each of them.
   To order any replacement parts from the dealer, the 
VIN will be required.  Be prepared.

   1. Removing the snap ring (456) from the output
       shaft, as shown in Figure 123, will allow you
       to disassemble the geartrain using Figure 123
       as a guide.
   2. The rear sun gear changed with the bushing
       being replaced with a ball bearing, as shown in
       Figure 124.
   3. This allowed the elimination of the number 9
       thrust bearing and number 10 thrust bearing
       race, as shown in Figure 124.

   5. The F-2 sprag was upgraded from 14 elements
       to 20 elements and the Mercedes part number
       is 220 270 01 31.  The F-2 sprag uses 1 brass
       end bearing that is integral to the cage and uses
       only one snap ring, as shown in Figure 125.
       The 14 element sprag is known to slip, which
       create gear ratio error codes.  
       Note: Do Not use 14 element sprag.
   6. Install new 20 element F-2 sprag into the rear
       sun gear, as shown in Figure 125.
       Note: The elements fall out of the cage very
       easily.  This does not mean that the sprag is
       defective.  Insert the elements back into the
       cage, as shown in Figure 126.
   7. If you have the late ball bearing style, install
       spacer and ball bearing with the step facing up,
       as shown in Figure 127.
       Note: The ball bearing is pressed into the
       rear sun gear.

 20. Install new "D" ring seal into the groove on the
       K-3 clutch piston, as shown in Figure 133, and
       lube with small amount of Trans-Jel®.
 21. Install the completed K-3 clutch apply piston
       into the housing, as shown in Figure 134.
 22. Install the return spring on top of apply piston,
       as shown in Figure 134.
 23. Install the "L" shaped snap ring by pressing
       into position until you hear it snap.
       Note: Snap ring is "L" shaped to keep return
       spring centered on piston.
 24. Use caution when installing K-3 clutch plates.
       Caution: The K-3 clutch may have 3, 4, or 5
       "double-sided" friction plates depending on
        the model.  Refer to the chart in Figure 134
       for reference.
       Later models may also use the "single-sided"
       friction plates.  We will cover the assembly
       process for both.
       All friction plates should be soaked in proper
       fluid for 30 minutes before installation.

 34. Measure K-3 clutch clearance using a feeler
       gauge between the selective snap ring and the
       backing plate, as shown in Figure 139.
 35. K-3 clutch clearance will depend on how many
       friction plates are used in the pack.  The proper
       clearances for each are listed in Figure 139.
       Note: ATSG clutch clearances vary from the
       Mercedes specification, as Mercedes uses a
       rather costly tool to compress the cushion
       plate in the clutch pack.
 36. Change the selective snap ring as necessary to
       obtain the proper clutch clearance.  There are
       5 different snap ring thickness' available and
       are listed in Figure 139.

       Note: The number 7 and number 8 thrust
       bearings have been updated with three small
       protrusions stamped into the outer bearing
       race and spaced equally around the outside
       diameter, as shown in Figure 142.  This was
       done to prevent the outer race from turning
       in the rear carrier and clutch hub assembly.
       This increased durability by decreasing the
       planetary failures seen in the past.
 42. Ensure the number 7 thrust bearing is fully
       seated.
 43. Install the number 8 thrust bearing, as shown

 22. Use caution when installing B-2 clutch plates.
       Caution: The B-2 clutch may have 4, or 5
       "double-sided" friction plates depending on
       the model.  Refer to the chart in Figure 163.
       All friction plates should be soaked in proper
       fluid for 30 minutes before installation.
 23. Install the B-2 clutch dished cushion plate in
       the direction shown in Figure 162.
 24. Install the B-2 clutch .071" thick apply plate,
       as shown in Figure 162.
 25. Install "double-sided" clutches beginning with
       a friction plate and alternating with steel plates,
       as shown in Figure 162, until you have proper
       number of plates installed.
      Note: Steel plate thickness will vary depending
       on snap ring groove location and number of
       frictions required  (See Figure 163).
       Also unique to the B-2 clutch, steel plates are
       inside spline and frictions are external spline.
 26. Install the B-2 clutch backing plate, as shown
       in Figure 162.
 27. Install the B-2 clutch selective snap ring, as
       shown in Figure 162.

 28. Measure B-2 clutch clearance using a feeler
       gauge between the selective snap ring and the
       backing plate, as shown in Figure 164.
 29. B-2 clutch clearance will depend on how many
       friction plates are used in the pack. The proper
       clearances for each are listed in Figure 164.
       Note: ATSG clutch clearances vary from the
       Mercedes specification, as Mercedes uses a
       rather costly tool to compress the cushion
       plate in the clutch pack.
 30. Change the selective snap ring as necessary to
       obtain the proper clutch clearance.  There are
       5 different snap ring thickness' available and
       are listed in Figure 164.
 31. We have provided you with frequently used
       part numbers for the clutches in Figure 165.
       Keep in mind that part numbers can change
       without notice.
 32. Set completed B-2 clutch housing assembly
       aside for the final assembly process.

Valve Body Wear & Damage Concerns
   Concern 1: Notice in Figure 172 that there are two 
different   designs   of   the   Control  Valve   Pressure 
Regulator Line-Up (352).   The 1st design spring is 
known to break and creates delayed engagements and 
soft or flared shifts.  Mercedes part number for a new 
OEM spring is 140 993 58 01.
   Concern  2:  Inspect  the  inside  diameter  of  the 
overlap  regulator  valve  sleeves  for  signs  of  wear. 
Shiney  patches  indicate  excessive  wear.     These 
sleeves  are  available  from  Sonnax®  under  part 
number 68942-05K in a kit that includes all three of 
them.   Refer to Figure 170.   They are also available 
individually.

TRANSMISSION FINAL ASSEMBLY (CONT'D)
 26. End-play must be 0.3-0.5mm (.012"-.020") and
       you have a measurement of .035" in the example
       used above, so you will need a 0.5mm (.020")
       shim to obtain proper end-play 0.4mm (.015").
 27. There are 4 different thickness shims available
       and are listed in Figure 189.
 28. Install the proper shim from your calculation,
       into transmission on top of parking gear hub, as
       shown in Figure 189.
 29. Install ball bearing into transmission housing, as
       shown in Figure 189.
       Note: The closed side of the plastic cage faces
       the parking gear, as shown in Figure 189.
 30. Install the ball bearing retaining ring and ensure
       it is properly seated in the groove.
 31. Check with a feeler gauge and ensure there is
       no play between the bearing and snap ring, as
       shown in Figure 190.
       Note: If the snap ring will not go in, a thinner
       ring must be used.  If there is play between the
       ring and bearing, a thicker ring must be used.
 32. Retaining rings are available in three different
       thickness' of 2.0mm (.079"), 2.1mm (.083"), and
       2.2mm (.087").
 25. To calulate end-play subtract Measurement "B"
       from Measurement "A".
       Example:
       Measurement "A" = 39.72mm (1.564")
                                      Minus
       Measurement "B" = 38.83mm (1.529")
                              Equals  0.90mm   (.035")
